# Machine-Learning

This repository consists of the following implementations: 

1. ML_ass1 : Consists of implementation of Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes Classifier
2. Assignment2: It consists of codes for support vector machine and a kaggle competition which uses TFIDF (natural language processing) along with support vector machine. 
3. HW-3-NN: It consists of an implementation of a neural network using sigmoid activation function from scratch. Along with this it has code for neural networks using Skit-Learn 
4. Homework4: Consists of codes containing reinforcement learning and clustering (implementation from scratch)

5. Machine-learning-ex(1,2,3): These are from the Andrew Ng machine learning course on coursera.
